# Custom React Native App Template

## 🚀 How to use

- Install packages with `npm install`.
  - If you have native iOS code run `npx pod-install`
- Run `npm start` to start the bundler.
- Open the project in a React runtime to try it:
  - iOS: [Client iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id982107779)
  - Android: [Client Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&referrer=blankexample)

## Adding Native Code

You may find that you want to add more native code later on. You can do this by ejecting the project and rebuilding it yourself.

- Run `npm run eject` to create the native projects.

## Publishing

- Deploy the native app to the App store and Play store using this guide: [Deployment](https://docs.expo.io/distribution/app-stores/).
